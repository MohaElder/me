Rapter once told me that he had a plan to move to somewhere in New Mexico, where he could get an acre of land in a reservation for a low price. I asked Rapter: "That's quite far away from here, why don't you just move to Slab City?" "There's too many crazy people there" Rapter answered. Since I recently went to Slab City at that time, I told Rapter that it's actually pretty chill there, "it's just white people doing drugs and a few lunatics". 

Rapter shrugged and replied, "Exactly, white people doing drugs!" "But aren't you also a white guy doing drugs? I mean if you don't wanna do the hard ones you can just not do it there no?" I argued. 

Then, Rapter shared one of the wisest lines I ever heard: "When you move to a place, you don't just move there. You join the community there. I am already a white guy doing drugs, so I don't have to join a group of white people doing drugs".

That made perfect sense to me.
