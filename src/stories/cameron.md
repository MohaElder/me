I met Cameron when I was driving from San Diego to Alaska.

That day, the landlord of my Airbnb warned me that there was a big hole on the road ahead. I didn’t really believe it — I thought, how big could a hole be? So I drove on.
Turns out, it was really big. Big enough that I had to turn back to the town I’d just left.

On the way back, I saw a man in an orange vest standing by the roadside, hitchhiking. I stopped.
His name was Cameron. He told me he was trying to get back home — to Watson Lake — which, unfortunately, was on the other side of that same hole.

I agreed to give him a ride back to town, and once the hole was fixed, to take him the rest of the way. In return, he promised to treat me to some moose meat when he got home.

On the drive, Cameron told me his story — starting with the most surprising part: he only had one eye. The other was a marble ball. A good one, too — I wouldn’t have noticed if he hadn’t told me.

He said he was part of an Indigenous community in Canada. He’d worked construction all his life and was now studying criminology at a community college nearby. He was heading home to see his mother.

“So how did you travel from school all the way to the big hole?” I asked.

“I hitchhiked,” he said. “When the bus driver saw the hole, he just left me and drove off.”

A few days later, the big hole was patched, and we continued north.

The scenery began to change — wide mountains, old ranches asleep at their feet, forests wrapping them like blankets. Cameron pointed to one of the ranches and said he used to know the people who lived there.

“I don’t know if they’re still around,” he said, “but I used to trade comic books with the girl who lived there.”

I looked at him. “We’re still a hundred miles from Watson Lake,” I said. “How’d you manage that?”

He smiled.
“When the truck drivers came through, I gave them my book, and they gave me hers. On their way back, she got mine.”

It's like passing a message in a bottle through the woods.

When we finally reached his place, I met his mother — a gentle old lady, almost like a Chinese grandma. Then his brother, who seemed crazy.

That night, we had the moose meat. It was cooked like borscht, thick and warm, served with handmade bread from his mom.

The meal was quiet. The kind of quiet that feels full — like a dinner your mom cooks when you’re small. The kind that makes you say “I’m full” when you’re not, but you still finish everything on your plate anyway.
