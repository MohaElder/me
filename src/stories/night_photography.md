title: Night Photography Technique

At the photography workshop in La Jolla, Jane taught me a technique that revolutionized my night photography.

"Most people think night photography is about long exposures," she explained while setting up her tripod on the beach. "But it's really about understanding light sources and their relationships."

She showed me how to balance artificial lights with natural ambient light, creating layers of depth that made the night come alive. The key, she said, was to see the darkness not as an absence of light, but as a canvas where different light sources paint the scene.

That night, we photographed the pier for hours, and I finally understood what she meant. Every shot was a carefully orchestrated dance between streetlights, moonlight, and the distant glow of the city.
