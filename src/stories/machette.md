Rapter told me that, a few years ago(from 2023), there's a woman who was carrying a large machette came over to the spot. "She was fat." Rapter said. The woman said that she's from Rancho Santa Fe (a rich neighborhood in San Diego, USA) and owns a ranch there. She's looking for a man to sleep with her for a few weeks for $200 a week, with meal and bed. Rapter told me that one of the guy went, who was a VA with some disabilities. 

I asked Rapter, that sounds awesome, why didn't you go? He said: "Because shes' SO UN-FUCKABLE!"

Turns out a few weeks later, the VA guy returned and told Rapter: "She was always over me that I couldn't even breathe!". I laughed and asked Rapter if the guy got the money. Rapter said yes.
