Last time I went to Slab City with my friend Yi Ning, we met Jerry.

It was dark when we arrived, cruising around to find a spot to camp. Then we saw a bonfire — a few guys, a bunch of dogs, and some beer. It was kind of a red flag, but we went over anyway, mostly because I wanted to take some good photos.

I walked up and said, “Hey guys, can we join you all?” while holding up the pack of beer I brought. One of the tall white guys said yes. We sat by the fire, and I cracked a beer for each of them — like a good old Chinese would.

As they thanked me and took the beers, I took a moment to look around. There was a young Hispanic guy with a bandana covering his lower face. The tall white guy who looked family-friendly, another bearded one with a similar vibe, and finally, Jerry — an old white man in a wheelchair. He looked exactly like what you’d imagine a Vietnam War vet to look like.

He actually reminded me of a guy I met at the Spot in UCSD — also a VA, also named Jerry, except that one didn’t have an arm. Maybe I’m mixing them up.

The Slab City Jerry, just like the UCSD one, was talkative. Sometimes he spoke English I couldn’t fully catch. He told me all the dogs were his. Then he nodded to them and said I could pet them now. I reached for one — the dog was calm, obedient.

As we talked, the guys started throwing rubber wheels, plastic, basically any non-compost trash they could find into the bonfire to keep it going.

I asked one of them if it’s true that there are gunshots every day in Slab City. They said yes — but claimed most people just do it for fun. Then they looked at Jerry.

“For example,” John, one of the white guys, said, “Jerry causes half of that shit here.”

Jerry laughed, and John kept going:
“This guy’s got a fucking air cannon at his place. Every morning at six, he gets up and fires one shot. We used to think it was the nearby military base training — but no, it was him.”

It is the mist of war.

Before we left, they told us there’s a good burger joint in town we should check out. So we went there the next day. The owner was an interesting person too — but that’s a story for another time.

While we were there, a Slab City resident came in and sat with us. She was really kind — even helped us pay because the owner only took cash. While we chatted, she told us about a mad man in Slab City.

“There’s a crazy guy,” she said. “He fires a cannon into the sky every morning. One day, he’s going to kill someone.”

I looked at Yi Ning and smiled.

I remembered last night. Jerry, leaving the bonfire with his twelve dogs, all leashed, walking into the mist.
