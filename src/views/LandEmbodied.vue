        us every step of the way.</i>
    </p>
    <p>"I'm deeply moved by the work produced by these young artists. They've shed their self imposed limitations and
      in that process found the voice and a beautiful community." - Dmitri Zurita</p></div>
   
    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p class="first-letter"> People love to gamble — whether it's in casinos, betting with friends, or even making a personal wager on
      whether the traffic light will turn green at the next beat drop of the song you're listening to. The reason?
      People thrive on the thrill of winning. That feeling is magnified when you go all in, when you have nothing left
      to lose. We often suppress this desire, but deep down, we all wish to be that protagonist in the movies who bets
      everything they have and emerges victorious. Even if we don't win, the rush, the surge of adrenaline, is
      intoxicating—like a wild mustang running naked through the Mojave Desert.</p>
    <p>In this show, we present you a series of works that expresses this "all or nothing" feeling originating from the
      artists' most vulnerable parts. You will see violence in action, naked bodies, and all the other explicit content
      that one might interpret as an R-rated movie. If you see it that way, it's ok. Because that is the way many of the
      artists in this exhibition might have seen these works at the start of this school year. People create art for
      reasons, even when it comes to an art with no reasons, that is also a reason. The artists of this exhibition have
      all gone through an inspiring and explicit journey that prompts each to discover and challenge one's most
      vulnerable spots. These journeys include getting your work constantly commented as boring, making out in the
      darkroom, almost losing your professor's trust because of some stupid high-school vibe thing, caging yourself
      inside a dog cage, being a joker, running naked covered with blood in the forest, carving yourself, and more.</p>
    <p>We invite you, as you explore the works in this exhibition, to immerse yourself in these journeys and to find
      echoes of your own vulnerabilities within them. It is a treacherous and uncomfortable trip to delve into these
      deepest scars of your life. Yet, if you dare to face those scars and express them, you may find yourself
      omniscient about your own existence and even omnipotent in other aspects of your life—or this world. As an old
      Chinese quote says, "知人者智，自知者明 (A truly strong person has no fear of exposing their weakest points)" It is our
      hope that everyone who visits this exhibition will emerge as a better version of themselves, evolving through this
      experience. In the end, self-hatred and nihilism cage us, but only love sets us free and carries us above and
      beyond. We are young, and we have nothing to lose. Even if you're old, you still have nothing to lose when you're
      ready to take your emotions on an adrenaline trip that gives you a head rush via a journey into vulnerability.</p>

          <p>By Erqian Sun <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gracersun_/">@gracersun_</a></p>
          <p>Paris, France, 2024. Les Parisiens captures a fleeting moment of Paris urban life, where strangers share space yet remain disconnected. A subtle hand gesture hints at hidden intentions, inviting the viewer to interpret the quiet tension within the everyday scene.</p>

          <p>By Ryan Giordano <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryangiordanophotographyco/">@ryangiordanophotographyco</a></p>
          <p>This photograph was shot in The Blue Lagoon located in the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea in the fall of 2023. The Edge of Stillness shows party goers on a day cruise which meets the waters quiet and still waters of the Blue Lagoon. Then the edge which is the separation of the quiet waters and the party goers get broken, the party goers are then in the Lagoon. This then embodies them in the environment of the Blue Lagoon surrounded by the cliffs and the sea life in the Lagoon.</p>
