        us every step of the way.</i>
    </p>
    <p>"I'm deeply moved by the work produced by these young artists. They've shed their self imposed limitations and
      in that process found the voice and a beautiful community." - Dmitri Zurita</p></div>
   
    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p class="first-letter"> People love to gamble — whether it's in casinos, betting with friends, or even making a personal wager on
      whether the traffic light will turn green at the next beat drop of the song you're listening to. The reason?
      People thrive on the thrill of winning. That feeling is magnified when you go all in, when you have nothing left
      to lose. We often suppress this desire, but deep down, we all wish to be that protagonist in the movies who bets
      everything they have and emerges victorious. Even if we don't win, the rush, the surge of adrenaline, is
      intoxicating—like a wild mustang running naked through the Mojave Desert.</p>
    <p>In this show, we present you a series of works that expresses this "all or nothing" feeling originating from the
      artists' most vulnerable parts. You will see violence in action, naked bodies, and all the other explicit content
      that one might interpret as an R-rated movie. If you see it that way, it's ok. Because that is the way many of the
      artists in this exhibition might have seen these works at the start of this school year. People create art for
      reasons, even when it comes to an art with no reasons, that is also a reason. The artists of this exhibition have
      all gone through an inspiring and explicit journey that prompts each to discover and challenge one's most
      vulnerable spots. These journeys include getting your work constantly commented as boring, making out in the
      darkroom, almost losing your professor's trust because of some stupid high-school vibe thing, caging yourself
      inside a dog cage, being a joker, running naked covered with blood in the forest, carving yourself, and more.</p>
    <p>We invite you, as you explore the works in this exhibition, to immerse yourself in these journeys and to find
      echoes of your own vulnerabilities within them. It is a treacherous and uncomfortable trip to delve into these
      deepest scars of your life. Yet, if you dare to face those scars and express them, you may find yourself
      omniscient about your own existence and even omnipotent in other aspects of your life—or this world. As an old
      Chinese quote says, "知人者智，自知者明 (A truly strong person has no fear of exposing their weakest points)". It is our
      hope that everyone who visits this exhibition will emerge as a better version of themselves, evolving through this
      experience. In the end, self-hatred and nihilism cage us, but only love sets us free and carries us above and
      beyond. We are young, and we have nothing to lose. Even if you're old, you still have nothing to lose when you're
      ready to take your emotions on an adrenaline trip that gives you a head rush via a journey into vulnerability.</p>

          <h3>Happy accidents</h3>
          <p>By Nataly Pastukhov <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nats.lenses/">@nats.lenses</a></p>
          <p>This 17 1/2-foot scroll was created from a series of experimental photographs. It captures a unique moment
            of
            accidental creativity. The film roll was accidentally thrown in the washing machine which caused a chemical
            effect on it that initially seemed like a mistake. However, after scanning and digitally assembling the
            images
            a captivating and abstract narrative was revealed. The scroll combines organic textures and fluid patterns,
            inviting viewers to explore the beauty found in imperfection and the unexpected.</p>

          <h3>Never Again</h3>
          <p>By Nataly Pastukhov <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nats.lenses/">@nats.lenses</a></p>
          <p>This work tells the story of a painful experience, with each print depicting the events. The 4 smaller
            photographs lined together are darkroom printed, with each effect on them representing the words. The top
            print has cum and spit on it, the second handprints, the third bite marks, and the 4th blood. All these
            photographs come together as the mattress rotates to reveal the bigger print displaying a bold and truthful
            statement.</p>

              href="https://www.instagram.com/galeria.de.vanessa/">@galeria.de.vanessa</a></p>
          <p>A chemigram is a form of creation where art and substances are applied directly to darkroom paper that has
            been exposed to light, creating unpredictable and abstract results once ran through the chemical process.
            For
            this piece, the two artists covered themselves in body oil and had sex on 45 sheets of darkroom paper taped
            together, leaving an imprint of the connection on each one.</p>

          <p>By Nataly Pastukhov <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nats.lenses/">@nats.lenses</a></p>
          <p>These photographs capture the raw, unfiltered freedom of self-expression through moments shared with
            friends.
            The images explore vulnerability, joy, and acceptance, as the subjects embrace their bodies and freedom
            without shame. Through this work artists celebrate personal growth, the breaking of internal barriers, and
            the
            beauty of life's fleeting, candid moments.</p>

          <p>By Nataly Pastukhov <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nats.lenses/">@nats.lenses</a></p>
          <p>Location: Darkroom, Room 401</p>
          <p>Directions: Walk around the corner of Commons Gallery; in front of the side entrance of the Epstein
            Theater.
          </p>
          <p>"If you are naked in the forest covered in pigs blood you will be the scariest thing out there" For this
            piece viewers are invited to both look and interact. The text surrounding the tent is words said by men,
            painted on the cloth with pigs blood. Outside sits a table with markers, allowing viewers to interact and
            write down their own experiences with painful words onto the cloth. Near the entrance of the tent you will
            be
            asked to take off your shoes and enter. Inside you will be faced with life size photo prints, along with
            smaller ones and offered a lamp to illuminate the photographs. Come to see, reflect and interact with this
            work right around the corner.</p>

          <p>This series aims to visualize the lives of young women living their lives fearlessly, through photography.

          <p>By Yasushi Oh <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anzhi.weng/">@anzhi.weng</a></p>
          <p>Growing up without my father, I was shaped by the love of my mom and her family, yet I couldn't ignore the
            absence of a father figure, especially as a child. Inspired by the film Come and See, which confronts
            reality
            through raw observation, I chose to revisit key moments tied to my father to seek resolution. This VR photo
            book invites you to step into that journey to come and see.</p>

          <p>By Yasushi Oh <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anzhi.weng/">@anzhi.weng</a> & Nataly Pastukhov <a
              href="https://www.instagram.com/nats.lenses/">@nats.lenses</a> & Kelly Tapia <a

          </p>
          <p>Breath Before Death Awakes captures our reckless youth, smoking not just for stress or focus, but for the
            raw
            headrush that makes us feel alive. It's a trade—health for fleeting highs—that mirrors how we chase
            intensity
            in work, love, or faith. This project immortalizes those dumb yet deeply emotional moments that fuel our
            art.

          <p>By Leo Noriega <a href="https://www.instagram.com/photo.book_1/">@photo.book_1</a></p>
          <p>The point of this piece is to show where I am from and how much I appreciate Los Angeles. I put many
            different pictures that describe LA and put in a LA dodgers theme because they won the World Series
            recently.
            LA is where I hold many memories (good and bad). I will always cherish the learning experiences and fun
            moments for the rest of my life.</p>

          <h3>Fire Hydrants</h3>
          <p>By Zelda Waite <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zeldawaite/">@zeldawaite</a></p>
          <p>The project fire hydrants was initially created for a course project. As much of the work, I explore it aims to capture an investigation and presentation of industrial items that are commonly considered ugly to look at or unsatisfying or even unpleasing or unwanted. Through intentional focus on these typically undesired subjects I try to explore both the things that I find personally intriguingor  beautiful, and also the beauty in its intended utility. The first part of a larger series fire hydrants is a set of 12 images, capturing several different fire hydrants from various different angles. Although at first many, interpret this to be a series of a single fire hydrant this is not in fact the case, and the series is actually comprised of several different fire hydrants.</p>

          <p>By Zelda Waite <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zeldawaite/">@zeldawaite</a></p>
          <p>Hollywood toilet is intended to be a comedic analysis and play with the idea of the glamour of Hollywood contrasted with much of the messy disgusting parts of the industry that are often hidden behind curtains from the public. Famed for its beauty and elegance behind the large walls of posters and slogans there's the shit piles people try to hide. From eating disorders and stolen work to grimy disgusting habits like the countless sexual assault charges of producers and actors alike and bribery and payoffs—-the glamorous Hollywood is really just not oh so glamorous.</p>
