# me
This is the source page of my personal website

It's a purely static website powered by Vue. I use Github Action + Github Pages + a Python script to perform content update for my blogs and photos.

The website uses [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for UI support. I added my own designs and some gentle touches based on some primitive Vuetify demos in its documentation to form the UI of the website. The wave animation is inspired by [Apple's Airpods Pro Ad](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/).

The python script that I wrote helps me to generate two js files to serve as config files for blogs and photos. It has a minimal TUI which provides easy access to its functions.

If you like the way I develop my website, feel free to give me a star! If you want to use my website to build your own website, feel free to do so.
